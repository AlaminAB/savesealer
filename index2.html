                    <img src="assets/img/freezerburn.jpg" class="float-right pl-2" alt="freezerburn">
                
               
                                <p>My daughter opened the fridge when she spotted it.</p>
                                <p>"Ew, gross," she said with a frown on her face. "You're not gonna make us eat that, are you?"</p>
                                <p>I took a look to see what she was on about. And I had to admit it looked pretty bad. </p>
                                <p>On the top shelf of the fridge, I was thawing out 3 steaks for dinner. I paid almost $25 for them. But now that they defrosted, they turned an ugly brown color. What's worse, they were soaking in blood-colored liquid that ran off from the meat.</p>

                                <blockquote >
                                    <p>&ldquo;I was sick and tired of having quality meat ruined in the freezer...&rdquo;</p>
                                </blockquote>
                           
                                
                           
                       
                        <p>I froze these steaks straight from the store. Now that they defrosted, the steaks looked bad. And I knew from previous experience, they would taste even worse than they looked — dry, tough, with a slight metallic flavor.</p>
                        <p>Why did this happen so often? I was sick and tired of wasting money on quality meat and having it ruined in the freezer. I made it my mission to figure out how to freeze and unfreeze food properly. Here's what I found.</p>
                    
                </div>
                <!-- section 2 -->
                <div class="section2">
                    <h2>It’s NOT about how you defrost</h2>
                    <p>It turned out it's not about how you thaw food. It's about how you freeze it to begin with.</p>
                    <p>You've probably heard of something called "freezer burn." If you ever take frozen meat out and it's got a fine layer of frost on it, then you've seen freezer burn. </p>
                    <p>Freezer burn happens because moisture is getting sucked out of your food and freezing on the surface of the meat. In essence, you're taking that nice piece of meat and dehydrating it &mdash; making jerky out of it.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>&ldquo;Freezer burn ruins the flavor and texture of your meat...&rdquo;</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>To make things worse, when you defrost your food, that frozen moisture melts and runs off. You're left with a spongey, discolored piece of mush. Because of freezer burn, meat loses its flavor and texture. It becomes gross, as my daughter pointed out so eloquently.</p>
                    <p>But here's the crazy thing. Freezer burn doesn't ALWAYS happen. I knew from occasional experience it's possible to freeze meat and have it preserved perfectly. What was the difference those times?</p>
                </div>
                <!-- section 3 -->
                <div class="section3">
                    <h2>The real culprit behind freezer burn</h2>
                    <p>It turns out the real culprit is air. The more air your food is exposed to in the freezer... the more freezer burn you get.</p>
                    <p>I won't get into the science of it. But basically, imagine a wet towel. If you bunch up that towel inside a plastic bag, the towel will stay wet for a long time. But spread the towel out in open air, and it will dry out quickly.</p>
                    <div class="section3-img">
                        <img src="assets/img/dryair.jpg" alt="dryair">
                        <p>The dry air in your freezer sucks out moisture and ruins your food</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Something similar happens with the meat in your freezer. The dry freezer air wants to suck out as much moisture from your food as it can. It wants to ruin that steak you've been saving for a special occasion.</p>
                    <p>So if air is the real culprit behind freezer burn, can you guess what the solution is? Yep, it&rsquo;s to get rid of all the air around your food. And here&rsquo;s how you do that. </p>
                    <h3>The Goldilocks solution</h3>
                    <p>I read a few different recommendations for getting rid of air around your frozen food.</p>
                    <p>Some people say to just use regular Ziploc bags, and squeeze out as much air as you can. But I tried this before and it didn't work well. Even a little bit of air left in the bag could still cause freezer burn.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, even the simplest vacuum sealer costs hundreds of dollars...&rdquo;</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Option two is to buy a vacuum sealer. Basically, this is a fancy device that looks like a printer and shrink-wraps your food. The trouble is, even the simplest vacuum sealer costs hundreds of dollars and is complicated to use. Both of these were a no-no for me.</p>
                    <p>And then there's option three. It's a kind of Goldilocks solution. It gets rid of all the air around your food, it eliminates freezer burn completely, and it's very affordable and easy. It's called SaveSealer.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- section4 -->
                <div class="section4">
                    <h2>No air at the press of a button</h2>
                    <p>The <a href="index.html">SaveSealer system has two parts.</a> They are both important. </p>
                    <p>The first part is sealable plastic bags. They come in several different sizes. You just put meat or any other food into them, just like you would with a regular Ziploc bag.</p>
                    <p>The special thing is these bags have a little valve on them. And that's where the second part of SaveSealer comes in.</p>
                    <div class="section3-img">
                        <img src="assets/img/savesealer.gif" alt="dryair">
                        <p>SaveSealer pump sucks out all the air</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Part two of the SaveSealer system is a little pump that connects to the valve on each bag. Click the pump into the little valve on the bag, press a button, and watch as the bag gets sucked in and clings tightly to the food you've stored inside. All the air has just been removed. </p>
                    <p>And you know what that means? That&rsquo;s right. No air, no freezer burn. No freezer burn, and your food stays fresh and tasty instead of becoming disgusting. But that's not all.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section5">
                    <h2>A revolution in my kitchen</h2>
                    <p>SaveSealer have been a revolution in my kitchen. Yesterday, I defrosted two steaks. They were sealed in SaveSealer bags. There was zero freezer burn. When they thawed, there was no runoff liquid and the color was a perfect red. </p>
                    <div class="section3-img">
                        <img src="assets/img/steak.jpg" alt="dryair">
                        <p>Since using SaveSealer bags, I never get freezer burn on meat any more</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>So when I got home tonight, I seasoned them, and cooked them beautifully. They were absolutely delicious. Even my daughter had a few compliments for me. </p>
                    <p>But get this. SaveSealer do more than just eliminate freezer burn.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section5">
                    <h2>Also good for food in your fridge and cupboards</h2>
                    <p>Ever put an open avocado in the fridge and have it turn brown? Or have cheese get all dry and orange at the corners? Or have vegetables wilt and sag after just a couple days?</p>
                    <p>In all these cases, it&rsquo;s air that&rsquo;s the problem once again. Air gets around your food, and causes it to spoil much faster. But no more. SaveSealer suck that air out and keep your food fresh so much longer. </p>
                    <div class="section3-img">

                    </div>
                    <p>I use SaveSealer bags to store veggies and fruits longer. I use them for lunch meats and smoked salmon, too. I even use them to keep cereals and coffee fresh for longer in the cupboard. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section5">
                    <h2>Saves money, space, and flavor</h2>
                    <p>I got the SaveSealer starter kit three months ago. The pump still works perfectly. You just charge it with a regular USB cable every few days, and it&rsquo;s always good to go. </p>
                    <p>The bags themselves are quick and convenient. They are washable and reusable indefinitely. You get a package of 8 different-sized to start with, but I bought some more later just because I get so much value out of them, all the time. </p>
                    <div class="section3-img">
                        <img src="assets/img/bagss.jpg" alt="dryair">

                    <p>They save space in the fridge. They keep food fresh and keep flavors longer. And they save me so much money, since I almost never throw food away any more.</p>
                    <p>Do you need any more reasons to give these SaveSealer a try? All right, then let me tell you one final thing. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section5">
                    <h2>BPA-free and good for sous vide</h2>
                    <p><a href="index.html">SaveSealer bags are made out of BPA-free plastic.</a> That means they are completely safe to boil food in. This is kind of new to me, but apparently there's a whole big movement known as sous vide, where people slow boil food in BPA-free plastic bags. Sous vide preparation is supposed to preserve flavors much better, because you don't expose meat to super high temperatures.</p>
                    <div class="section3-img">
                        <img src="assets/img/sousvide.jpg" alt="dryair">

                    <p>I haven't tried sous vide cooking yet, but I'm planning on it soon. And it's so cool to know that I have what I need with just the SaveSealer bags. You can just plop them in water, and you're good to go. And even if I never wind up doing sous vide cooking, it makes me feel good to know that the bags are so high quality and that they are BPA-free. </p>

                <div class="section6">
                    <h2>A no-brainer investment</h2>
                    <p>These SaveSealer bags paid for themselves the first week I started using them. Like I said, I used to throw away at least some food every week, and it really added up. Fruit would spoil, veggies would get brown, or the worst, meat would get ruined with freezer burn.</p>
                    <p>But no more. These SaveSealer bags are saving me money. My fridge looks neater and cleaner. And all the food I store in this way stays fresh and tasty so much longer. </p>
                    <p>I can't recommend these bags enough. If you care about saving money and about keeping your food fresh, then <a href="index.html">this will be the best investment you make this year.</a> Try them out, you won't regret it!</p>
                    <h2>40% off at the moment</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE: I just <a href="index.html">found a site that's running a 40% sale on SaveSealer.</a> I'm definitely going to grab some more bags myself. But they are also selling the entire SaveSealer starter kit (bags + pump).</p>

                        Yes, absolutely. That&rsquo;s the point.

                        It&rsquo;s super simple. Just put the pump on the bag and press the button. It sucks out the air in a second. <ul class="list-inline d-sm-flex my-0">
